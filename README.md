## Hi there 👋

I'm trinity, I'm a former student at [INSA Rennes](https://www.insa-rennes.fr/) where I got an engineering degree in computer sciences. I like FOSS.
I'm mainly interested in low level stuff and languages (Rust, C...), and DevOps (who likes regression in their code?). I also like security, cryptography and distributed systems.


**🔭 I’m currently working on** [Garage](https://git.deuxfleurs.fr/Deuxfleurs/garage/), and sometime [Plume](git.joinplu.me/Plume/Plume/)

**😄 Pronouns :** they/them

**⚡ Fun fact :** I find ☕ highly overrated, 🍵 is a lot better
